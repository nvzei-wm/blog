### Summary and Reflection on Datu’s Speech



*On May 3rd, 2023, nvzei_colelctive was very lucky to have Datu (Zheng Churan) to share her Chinese feminist activism experiences. We took some notes and organized them here for people who might be interested. Please note that all of the photos are found online, so they would be different from what was shared during the presentation. While we tried our best to recall here, we do not have the full capacity to document everything—Datu would give more talks in the future, and please join if you want to hear from her directly. Otherwise, we hope we can be somewhat helpful. We welcome any feedback or ideas on actions after you read this.*

*Please let us know if you want to discuss any potential future activities online or in person. You can contact us by emailing nvzei_wm at proton.me or follow us on instagram on nvzei_collective_wbg*

Datu mentioned 3 most important years for her: 2012, 2015, and 2019. 

In 2012, she joined the feminist movement as she was graduating from Sun Yat-sen University at the time. Some of the “interesting” things they did are listed below:

They suited up and carried 27 kg of 咸猪手/salted pig groper (a Chinese cuisine). “咸猪手” means sexual harassment in Cantonese, and they ate them all in the government office areas of Guangzhou. This was the first anti-sexual harassment campaign in the streets in China, and “it was delicious”.

This was an effort to raise awareness of the scarcity of female’s public restrooms, by "occupying" the men's room.

In addition to the actions, they wrote letters to the representatives and conducted research on the matter. In 2016, the following year, they achieved a significant milestone when a government policy mandating a women to men's toilets ratio of 3:2 finally took effect.

They took other actions against gender discrimination in police station recruitment.. She also worked with women from different socioeconomic backgrounds. 

In 2014, during a sanitation worker’s strike in Guangzhou, she documented their action as a citizen journalist. According to Datu, this was an important year for the Chinese feminism movement, as it was the first time that feminists moved beyond theories and research in academic institutions and took it to the street, which then generated a lot of media coverage and public debates, leading to change in policies and regulations. Most of the activists are female college students.

In 2015, the authority cracked down on feminists for the first time. Datu launched a national action against sexual harassment right before the International Women’s Day. However, Datu and her friends were taken to the police station on March 6th. Later, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) transferred her to the National Security Detention Center in Beijing… While this was a traumatizing event as everyone would agree, it also proved how successful feminism activism was. 

Not surprisingly, it was not a pleasant experience for her. Her parents didn’t receive legal documents and details about why their daughter was taken away. There were abuses, interrogations through threatening, and horrible living conditions. She did not have her glasses, and there was minimal privacy. 

During her detention, Datu met with a lawyer once when she was detained, and was told that her friends and family were taking action. She did not know back then that there were vast amounts of actions, both domestically in China and internationally, calling for their release. 

After learning about the actions of these activists, Datu became more hopeful about the future of feminism in China. 

Internationally, feminists lobbied many feminist organizations and created the slogan “boycott the conference”, targeting the Chinese delegation to World Women’s Conference. Many prominent female leaders, including Hilary Clinton, openly expressed their support for the “Feminist Five”. A few years later, she learned that it was the effort from a group of Chinese feminists who were forced to stay abroad that contacted those organizations. 

“In fact, a movement is difficult to sustain without organizers.” The sole reason that the feminist movement sustains today is because there are many organizers contributing to the work.

Xianzi lost her case, but nobody really thought she would win at the very beginning. The effort Xianzi made in activism built a community around this issue, pushing the boundaries in the tightening space for feminism/any social movements. 

This brought us to another important question: “who is to define victory”? 

The definition of victory has been monopolized by the patriarchal society—it seems that only “overthrowing the government” can be considered a victory, just like in history how ROC overthrew Qing Dynasty, or how contemporary PRC was built. With this definition, there’s no victory in the Chinese feminism movement. However, this is only a victory in the patriarchal sensein Datu’s view, the victory in the feminist movement happens on a personal level. 

It is important to claim this victory, as it will fuel future feminism activism. More often than not, activism is presented with tragic heroism, which is a form of defeatism that leaves everyone with despair. But this is simply not true, because of all of the organizing, the feminist communities have become stronger over the past 10 years. They have developed “very good ideas” of not having children and choosing not to marry, which will directly challenge the government’s strategies. It is a meaningful strike that shows how feminism challenges people’s minds. 

For Datu, her experience in activism also taught her that there is always a window of solidarity actions politically. It is very important to seize these windows of opportunities, so that the activists can actively take actions, instead of waiting for the police. 




In 2019, Datu’s husband Wei Zhili, an activist on labor rights, was detained by the police. Upon learning the news, she felt devastated. However, using what she has learned in years of activism, she borrowed her friend’s eyebrow pencil to write a slogan and took a picture with it. As more people started to pay attention to this post, the police called her with her husband’s location, which allowed her to take action sooner. She focused on raising public attention, because the police will be less likely to abuse her husband. 

There are 3 stages for her actions: 

In the first stage, the primary goal was visibility. Datu had the advantage of knowing her husband really well, so she wrote an article which presents Wei Zhili as a lively person, instead of a stereotypical hero, which is common in the stories of (arrested) human rights defenders. This will allow more people to be able to relate to the story, thus generating more public attention and actions. 

Her family was also very supportive, and organized more than 1000 people to send postcards to Wei Zhili and his friends who were also detained. This would let the police know that many people are paying attention and, again, they are less likely to be abused. 

Datu stressed that it is important to lower the bar for people to participate, because of the difficulty to recruit enough participants to perform challenging tasks within a short period of time—in her case, they bought stamps and wrote postcards for people who were not able to write the post cards themselves. 

The second stage needs to have an attention-grabbing on-site element to attract media attention and spread the messages. It is crucial to have new actions with an activism appeal following the first stage before the window for advocacy closes. Datu used the mask girl example calling for her own freedom a few years ago, this time with the photo of Wei Zhili and his friends. The photos spread on social media until the police intervened. After evaluating the cost of actions, Datu decided that the window for action has closed, which means the third stage began–

The persistent yet silent personal actions. Datu chose to do a “run for Wei Zhili” campaign, where she would exercise and post on social media to raise awareness. She is not a sports person, but she did it for 4 years to this day. Now, Wei Zhili is released on probation. 

Datu shared this story to show how feminism activism improved her organizing skills, and gave her the capability and courage to support her community through difficult times—all as a result of the victory of the feminist movement in China. 

Datu has three suggestions for people who care about the feminist movement:



1. Observe the feminist movement with patience and hope. The group has great potential and are able to take many actions, spreading awareness, online and offline, in China and internationally.
2. Pay attention to activities in local communities in China. Many feminists are still able to organize in-person activities and communities in China. For instance, during the White Paper Movement, the main organizers are all women.
3. Participate in overseas Chinese feminist movements. Feminists abroad are being increasingly active, organizing various events in support of the detained activists. The actions overseas can still resonate with what is happening within China, which will transfer back to China as people within China saw these actions.


In the US, without the limitations such as censorship in China, Chinese feminists are able to unite and produce quality content to be poured back to China. All actions mentioned above can be done together here.
