We are a group of politically-engaged students that stem out of the A4 Revolution (otherwise, known as the White Paper Revolution) and wanted to continue the resistance beyond the movement after the Zero-Covid Policy was repealed in December 2022.

We want to raise awareness and actively fight against the systemic oppression of people of color, queer bodies, and all marginalized communities, and against the white cis-heterosexual social order.

We aim to build a multi-lingual coalition of radical and politicized individuals and strive for solidarity beyond language and national boundaries.

Our goal is to create safe spaces where people can have open and honest conversations about identities, institutions, and inequalities. By fostering dialogues across diverse communities and regions, we aim to build networks that can effect positive social change.
